        <h3>A Day in My Life</h3>
                <p>I wake up excited for my coding class. After breakfast, I head to the classroom with my laptop. The instructor
                    covers programming concepts and guides us through coding exercises. I collaborate with classmates, ask
                    questions, and leave feeling accomplished. I review my notes and continue coding on personal projects, eager to
                    expand my skills further. Playing Games until the its time to sleep.
