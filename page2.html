        <h2>What I Do As a Security Guard</h2>
            <p>The responsibilities of a security guard include monitoring and surveillance of the premises, controlling access to the designated areas, responding to emergencies, enforcing rules and regulations, maintaining documentation through report writing, providing customer service, conducting patrols, and monitoring alarm systems. Security guards are tasked with observing and identifying any suspicious activities, verifying credentials, handling emergencies, enforcing safety protocols, documenting incidents, assisting visitors or employees, conducting regular patrols to deter threats, and promptly responding to alarm systems. They play a crucial role in maintaining the security and safety of the premises they are assigned to.
